# Gatsby Plugin Htaccess

This plugin creates a htaccess-file every time a gatsby build is triggered. 
This file contains by default all rules specified in the htaccess-file from HTML5 Boilerplate (6.1.0). 
Additionally recommended headers for HTTP caching are set: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/caching/
